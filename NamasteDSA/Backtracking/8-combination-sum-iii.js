/**
 Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
Each number is used at most once.
Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

Example 1:
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.

Example 2:
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.

Example 3:
Input: k = 4, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.

// Time Complexity: `O(k * 9 choose k)` - The number of combinations of choosing k numbers from 9.
// Space Complexity: O(k) - The maximum depth of the recursion tree can go up to k.
